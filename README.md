Matlab2048
==========

2048 crudely ported to Matlab. A single night project

There isn't much more to say about this. There are much better versions but if you only have Matlab but still really want to play it this will indeed work. Big thanks to MatlabDoug on StackExchange for the entire frontend and coloring (even though it is just grayscale)

Inevitably I'd like to add colors and a better UI
